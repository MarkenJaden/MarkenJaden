## Hi there üëã
I am Jaden, currently 18 years old and an apprentice. I am always and at all times learning about everything and am actually interested in pretty much everything. I love open source projects, it allows me to learn and others as well >.>
I program in pretty much all areas, just search my GitHub, you'll get a nice overview.
I wouldn't say I'm an overachiever, but I'm also anything but crappy at what I do.

I just enjoy it ^^

## Please take a look at my stats :)
